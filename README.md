# Traffic Congestion Detection using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement

### Title: 
Commuters frequently experience delays due to unexpected traffic incidents, leading to frustration and lost time. Current traffic management systems often lack predictive capabilities that would help prevent or mitigate delays.

### Background:
Commuters often face unexpected delays caused by sudden traffic incidents such as accidents, road closures, or weather conditions. These unforeseen events lead to frustration, increased travel time, and reduced productivity. Traditional traffic management systems typically respond reactively to incidents, without anticipating or mitigating potential delays in advance.

### Problem:
Current traffic management systems are unable to predict and prevent delays in real-time, which exacerbates traffic congestion. The lack of predictive capabilities in these systems means that commuters are often left to deal with congestion without warning, leading to inefficiencies in the transportation network and a poor user experience.

### Objective:
To develop a smart traffic management system that leverages machine learning and real-time data to predict and mitigate traffic delays. The system should be capable of detecting potential traffic incidents, adjusting traffic signals dynamically, and offering alternative routes to prevent or reduce congestion, thus optimizing traffic flow and minimizing commuter delays.

## Usage
The system employs a machine learning model to classify traffic congestion levels (heavy/light) based on camera feed inputs. Using this information, the traffic lights are adjusted in real-time to improve the flow and reduce wait times at intersections. The system also integrates data sources such as Google Maps API to recommend alternative routes in case of detected congestion.

## Features
- **Real-time Traffic Prediction**: Classifies traffic congestion as heavy or light using machine learning models.
- **Congestion Prediction**: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict traffic congestion as either heavy or light, achieving up to 92% accuracy.
- **Adaptive Traffic Signal Control**: Dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time congestion.
- **Route Optimization**: Suggests alternative routes to avoid congestion and reduce travel time.
